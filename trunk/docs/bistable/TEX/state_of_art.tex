\section{Quantum Dot Cellular Automata}
The base component of a QCA cell is the Quantum Dot, a nanostructure that can be built with different materials and different technologies which is able to store a well defined number of electrons. Using 4 quantum dots it's possible to create a cell like the one in figure \ref{img:cell}.

\end{figure}

If we inject 2 electrons in this structure their reciprocal repulsion allow them to be only in two configurations, with the electrons disposed on one of the two diagonals. Electrons are free to move according to a clock signal but they can never leave the cell.
The configuration in the picture above represents the logical bit 0 the opposite configuration is the bit 1. 
If we put two cells one beside the other we can see that the polarization of the first cells has an impact on the polarization of the other. This effect can be used to build complex logic circuits. Main blocks of QCA circuits are NOT and Majority Gate both shown in figure \ref{img:gates}.

\subsection{Clock}
\label{delay}
A key issue in the design of circuits is the definition of clock areas. This technology uses 4 identical clock signals which are shifted of $\frac{\pi}{4}$. Each clock signal has 4 clock phases: switch, hold, release and relax. During this phases potential barriers are raised or lowered inside the cell in order to control the movement of electrons. In the relax phase barriers are low and electrons can freely move inside the cell, during the switch phase barriers are raised and the movement of electrons are limited. during the hold phase electrons are not allowed to move within dots. In the relax phase the barriers are lowered. The alternation of clock phases identify the flow of information into the circuit. \newline
This technology is pipelined and the output of the circuit is given after a delay which is equal to the number of clock phases divided by four.

\section{QCADesigner}
QCADesigner is a tool made by the University of British Columbia to design and verify circuits in QCA technology. This tool offers two main feature. The first is to design with an intuitive graphical user interface a circuit, in the image \ref{img:ambiente} is showed a simple circuit, the second is to simulate the behavior of the circuit.

To verify the behavior of the system two simulation engines are offered. The bistable simulation and the coherence vector simulation. the aim of this report is to speedup the execution of the bistable simulation engine so we are going to briefly describe only this type of simulation. The coherence vector differs in the way the polarization of cells is calculated, it's much slower but gives more accurate result.


\subsection{Bistable Simulation}
Bistable simulation engine has been created in order to give designers a way to test their circuit very rapidly. For the simulation the cell is modeled as a two state system, for each cell the kink energy with respect to neighbor cells and the polarization is stored. the kink energy takes into account the cost of two neighboring cells with different polarizations. At each step of the execution the new polarization of each cell is calculated on the basis of the old polarizations and the kink energy of all neighboring cells, within a predefined radius. The approximations made by this simulation engine is sufficient to verify the logical behavior of the system but does't describe well it's dynamics. For the inspection of dynamic situations coherence vector engine should be used. The main advantage of this kind of simulation is that it's very quick with respect to the coherence vector engine.
