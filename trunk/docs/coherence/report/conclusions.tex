\chapter{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
Exhaustively simulating large and complex QCA cells based circuits using our CUDA implementation allows for an efficient exploitation of an arbitrarily large cluster of CUDA enabled cards. The theoretical speedup is limited only by the number of nodes present in the cluster (which directly maps on the number of concurrently runnable threads, ie the number of concurrently simulable QCA cells). As demonstrated in the Results chapter, the larger the number of cells, the improved the speedup with respect to the serialized version of the code.
Possible improvements for this application are the implementation of the simulation mode called ``vector table'' that allows for a reduction of the $2^i$ term of the complexity formulae by manually disabling some of the inputs cells of the design.
