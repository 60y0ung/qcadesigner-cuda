==================
basic installation
==================

`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type `make' to
compile the package. This will result in the basic CPU version to be compiled
for your machine.

============
make options
============

`make clean': delete the compiled files in bin/ folder
`make cuda': install the appropriate version of the cuda-enabled software on
your machine
`make cuda_x': where x can be any of 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0. This will result
into the compilation of the code assuming a compute capability of you cuda 
enabled device equal to x. Use only in case your nvcc fails at recognizing your
graphic card device.
