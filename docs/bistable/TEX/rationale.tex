\chapter{Rationale}\label{sec:rationale}
Quantum Dot Cellular Automata were cited among emerging technologies by the International Technology Roadmap For Semiconductors (\cite{art:ITRS_ERD}). The theoretical speed at which will be able to run is about 2 THZ and power consumption are extremely low (\cite{art:FPGA_Quantum}). Furthermore, this model has been demonstrated theoretically to be able to perform quantum computation (\cite{art:Quantum_QCA}).
QCADesigner is a useful tool which allows designing and simulating any QCA circuit. We profiled the execution time with different circuits and performances turned out to be really pure when circuits get bigger; a 25000 cells exhaustive simulation took about 7 hours on a Intel Xeon E5345 processor.\newline
We aim to speed up the simulator exploiting CUDA technology, providing a simple batch application able to simulate large circuits in competitive times.
