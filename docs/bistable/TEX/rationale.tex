\section{Why QCA}




- Why QCA?
	* novel emerging paradigm
	* 2 Thz, low energy consumption and miniaturization
	* quantum computing
- QCADesigner simulator slow on big circuits:
	* Every sample, each cell's polarization is computed based on the values of his neighbors, sequentially.
	* Bottleneck from profiling (table with times)
	* Simulation core: pseudo code
	* Identical operations repeated for each cell, big circuits -> thousands of cells
	* We chose to speedup this part of the code with CUDA because:
		 SIMD architecture (SIMT): single instruction repeated on different data
		 hundreds of core -> many threads running simultaneously, each thread responsible of computing a cell's polarization
		 scalable, adding new cores implies a greater number of cells computed simultaenously, higher speedup
- Objective
	* Speed up simulation for big circuits
	* batch simulator
	* Given a file .qca -> produce output: binary, continous values, plot on png, log with info of simulation
	* if same .qca -> same results CPU and CUDA
