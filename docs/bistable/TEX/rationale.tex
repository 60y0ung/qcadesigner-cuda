\chapter{Rationale}\label{sec:rationale}
Quantum Dot Cellular Automata were cited among emerging technologies by the International Technology Roadmap For Semiconductors (\cite{art:ITRS_ERD}). The theoretical speed at which will be able to run is about 2 THZ and power consumption are extremely low (\cite{art:FPGA_Quantum}). Furthermore, this model has been demonstrated theoretically to be able to perform quantum computation (\cite{art:Quantum_QCA}).
QCADesigner is a useful tool which allows designing and simulating any QCA circuit. We profiled the execution time with different circuits and performances turn out to be really pure when circuits get bigger.\newline
We aim to speed up the simulator exploiting CUDA technology, providing a simple batch application able to simulate big systems in competitive times.
