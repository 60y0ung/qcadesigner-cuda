\section{First approach}
The original source code of QCADesigner was downloaded from Mina website (ref). We attempted to make it compile as it was but we did not manage to solve several compilation errors. So we started to focus on the identification of the core algorithm supporting the tool in order to obtain a working batch simulator executable on CPU. This operation took us some weeks of work. Meanwhile we were able to deeply analyze the code. We made some hypothesis on the location of possible bottlenecks, we identified the data structures used to represent circuits and started to consider possible transformations that had to be done in order to obtain fast accessible and light weight data structures allocable on the GPU global memory.
