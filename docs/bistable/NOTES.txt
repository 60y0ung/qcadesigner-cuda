**THE TEAM**

**STATE OF THE ART**
- QCA 
	* QCADesigner
	* Two Engines: BISTABLE and COHERENCE, describe them shortly (see MINA site)
	-> BISTABLE IS JUST A FAST APPROXIMATION to test circuits
- CUDA

**RATIONALE**
- Why QCA?
	* 2 Thz, low energy consumption and miniaturization
	* quantum computing
- QCADesigner simulator slow on big circuits:
	* Every sample, each cell's polarization is computed based on the values of his neighbors, sequentially.
	* Bottleneck from profiling (table with times)
	* Simulation core: pseudo code
	* Identical operations repeated for each cell, big circuits -> thousands of cells
	* We chose to speedup this part of the code with CUDA because:
		^ SIMD architecture (SIMT): single instruction repeated on different data
		^ hundreds of core -> many threads running simultaneously, each thread responsible of computing a cell's polarization
		^ scalable, adding new cores implies a greater number of cells computed simultaenously, higher speedup
