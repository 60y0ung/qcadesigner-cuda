\begin{abstract}
The development of tools capable of simulating the behaviour of QCA based circuits is a fundamental and necessary step required for this technology to make progresses and to allow the fabrication of real world devices. We focus on the work of the MiNa Group from University of Columbia, and in particular on their QCADesigner simulation IDE/Engine. At their current development stage, even a simple circuit requires many hours of simulation in order to characterize its dynamic. In this work we focus on the bottlencks of their implementation and develop a parallelized solution based on nVidia CUDA technology, enabling a speedup of the performances (objective: execution time) proportional to the number of symmetric multiprocessors available on the system employed for simulation (with respect to the same circuit executed on a serial machine).
