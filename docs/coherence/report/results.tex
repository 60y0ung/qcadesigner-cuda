\chapter{Results}\label{sec:results}
correctness - tests done on a set of circuits
baseline: the original cpu code execution time
improvements: the mean and the peak speedup
graphs: speedup vs input size + ESTRAPOLAZIONE
        speedup vs cell size + ESTRAPOLAZIONE
speedup prediction accuracy as #cells*2^i/#threads / (real ex. time)
